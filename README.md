# Buddy System

##Introduction
This repository is an implementation of the Buddy memory allocation technique to simulate memory management. Of course, many such techniques exist, but this particular technique offers simple block splitting and coalescing. The project was assigned in an undergraduate Operating Systems course with Dr. G. Baliga.

##Stage 1 (Current)
In this stage, we have developed our own implementation of the Buddy memory allocation technique in an MVC architecture to allow for the creation of a GUI. We have also created extensive JUnit tests, that of this writing, all pass.

##Stage 2
In this stage, we will develop a GUI in Java using Swing. It is in development.
